# Express basic website

## Introduction

Pick a person that you admire and build a website that shares some basic information about them. They can be a writer, a musician, a celebrity, or someone you know personally.

You should resort to `express` to create your app, build the routing logic with the built-in app routing methods, and serve static content for every request.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

**All of your work should happen inside of the *starter-code* directory.**

As such, you should navigate to the directory and run `npm init -y` to create a package.json file, and install `express` by running `npm install express`.

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

1. A **Home** page, that welcomes the visitor and links to the other pages on the website.
2. An **About** page, that shares some basic information about the person.
3. A **Works** page, where you showcase some of the work of the person you chose.
3. Bonus: A **Photo Gallery** page, displaying some pictures of the person/their work.


**Your site should also have a `public/` folder for:**

- CSS stylesheets
- Images
- Bonus: A small script that adds basic interactions to the page (click events, fade ins, popups, etc.)

## Structure of Your Code

Your starter-code only has an empty `app.js` file.
In addition to that, you will need:

1. A `package.json` file (run `npm init` to create one).
2. Running npm install `express`.
3. A `views/` folder for your separate HTML files.
4. A `public/` folder for your publicly available files like CSS, images and (bonus) JavaScript.


Happy coding! ðŸ’™
